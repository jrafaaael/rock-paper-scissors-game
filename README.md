# Rock, Paper, Scissor Game

It is a game played by two people in which each player, simultaneously, performs with his hand one of the three allowed figures, which are: rock (closed fist), paper (outstretched hand) or scissors (a fist with the index finger and the middle finger extended, forming a V).

The game results in a tie if both players perform the same figure with their hand, or in victory if rock over scissors, scissors over paper or paper over stone were chosen.
